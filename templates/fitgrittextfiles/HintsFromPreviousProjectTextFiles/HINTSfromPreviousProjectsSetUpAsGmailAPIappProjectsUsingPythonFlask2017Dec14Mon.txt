2017 Dec 14 THu SUCCESS in sending email
In URL bar 127:/email

Didn't work before so it wouldn't work now
Displays message : INSUFFICIENT PERMISSION
since I had used quickstart.py with another 
gmail account 

Gmail app writes THE OTHER EMAIL ACCOUNT
into the .credentials file when I had used myshop2
project.
So our new gmail account has no authentication permission to access our .py file in our new current 
project sqlmail.


So change into .credentials folder,
REMOVE the name of other gmail account from
.credentials file .
DELETE the old .credentials file
PUT IN NEW name for .credentials file.
           OR
name credentials file as a diff name
change in application_name
to save multiple credentials saved on my computer
once adn do NOT have to wipe the previous one(credential) out, in order to use a new gmail app
in a different project.
  for eg :
  gmail -python quickstart
  gmail - python update email
..............
Go to Gitbash
^c
cd
ls -a
cd .credentials
ls -a
gmail python quickstart
rm gmail *
cd
CHANGE INTO LOCATION OF sqlmail PROJECT
